ToolKito E-Commerce APP
===================
The example app I have created is very minimal with very limited screens. 

**Login, Register** - screens to login or create a new user.
**Home** – To list down the available products along with name, thumbnail and price.
**Cart** – A BottomSheet view to maintain the cart items.
**Payment** – screen To make the necessary calls to backend server before redirecting user to payment gateway.
**Transactions** – To show the list of transactions made by a user.

Java package

===================
Currenlty this repo uses the demo REST API provided. You can build the backend project and change the base url in **app/build.gradle** file
